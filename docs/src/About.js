        You may not know this, but you basically already know Inkling. Inkling
        is a programming language that allows you to follow your gut. Do what
        makes sense to you while learning how to shift your thinking to become a
        better programmer and thinker. The language works to let you speak the
        language you code.
      </p>

        When the inkling team first met, we had a purpose. Each of us remembers
        the first time we learned to code. We all began with different
        languages- some Java, some Python, some C++, and more. While these
        languages are all great languages with special utilities, we wanted to
        create a language that would ease new computer scientists into
        programming to gain a strong foundation in coding. We drew upon our
        personal experiences as beginner programmers to build a language that
        was intuitive. Our goal is to encourage you to strengthen your skills
        and grow as a programmer with an intuitive beginner language. Why?
        Because you can.
